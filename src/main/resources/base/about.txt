%(app_name)s is an RSS aggregator designed for simplicity
and easy of use. Instead of burying you in hordes of folders
and "stuff," all of your subscriptions are internally tracked
and combined into a single view.

Upcoming versions of %(app_name)s will include more utilities
to make managing your subscriptions significantly more painless
and counteract the inconveniences introduced by combining all
items into a single list without compromising simplicity.
